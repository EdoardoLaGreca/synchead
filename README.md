# synchead
Sync C header files with their source

This program is meant to synchronize the header file with its implementation. All the function declarations in the header file may be overridden. The name must include the file name ending (e.g. `asdasd.h` is ok while `asdasd` is not). The source file must have the same name but with ending with `.c`.

## Usage

```
synchead [OPTIONS]... NAME
```

Where:
 - NAME is the header file name

## Options

 - `-v` - Verbose output. Prints which functions are being synced.
