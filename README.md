# synchead
Sync C source files with their headers

This program is meant to synchronize the header file with its implementation. All the function declarations in the header file are overridden. The name must include the file name ending (e.g. `asdasd.c` is ok while `asdasd` is not). The header file must have the same name but with ending with `.h`.

## Usage

```
synchead [OPTIONS]... NAME
```

## Options

 - `-v` - Verbose output. Prints which functions are being synced.
